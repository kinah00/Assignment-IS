#TurtleWay!

Background 
Plastic straw and climate changes. These words are no longer unusual to us. Climate changes is exposing sea turtles to threats and putting food production at risk. In the warming ocean, a strong female turtle named Timah, must find its way to find some food to survive. One day, Timah felt starving. She knew that she had to consume some energy because plastic straws would not do anything to her. Out of the sudden, she got stuck in between the coral reefs. Through the bleaching coral reefs, she tried to free herself. From the eagle eye view, the barriers look just like a maze! Starvation did not stop her persistency. In the presence of Graph Theory and Search Algorithm, this smart turtle discovered an algorithm called Breadth-first Search to solve her maze problem. What an ocean-genius! She attempted to draft some nodes and edges on the sand, hoping for a precious and scrumptious plate of nasi lemak, she decided to find the shortest path to eat. The starting node was labelled color apa while the end node is kaler yahoo. In the end, she found her way. Now, every ocean creature has known her from her intelligence. Her fame led to human acknowledgement. She had an interview for her journey and two women, the programmers believed that her story could be an interesting game to be coded in Python. Therefore, here comes this maze game, TurtleWay!
